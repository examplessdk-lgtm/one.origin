# Base44 App — TanStack Start

A full-stack Base44 app: [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) (React 19, plain JavaScript) with file-based routes, server functions and server routes, server-rendered and hosted by Base44.

## What is in the starter

| Route | File |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | `src/routes/index.jsx` — a server-rendered page whose loader calls a server function |
| `GET /api/time` | `src/routes/api/time.js` — a server route: a raw HTTP endpoint next to the pages |

## Run locally

```bash
npm ci
base44 login   # one-time per machine
base44 link    # one-time per clone
base44 dev     # local backend + app together
```

## Build and publish

```bash
npm run build         # -> dist/client (assets) + dist/server (the Worker)
base44 deploy         # or publish from the Base44 builder
```

There is no `index.html`: the HTML document is rendered on the server from `src/routes/__root.jsx`. The build runs through the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/), so dev and build both execute server code in `workerd`.

## How the pieces fit

- **Pages** are files in `src/routes/`. A route's `loader` runs on the server for a document request and in the browser for a client navigation; `Route.useLoaderData()` gives the component the resolved data.
- **Server functions** (`src/lib/server-fns.js`) are RPCs created with `createServerFn`. `src/start.js` runs every one of them through `authMiddleware`, which sends the visitor's token along, so `context.getBase44()` returns a client acting as that visitor and entity access rules apply. `context.getBase44().asServiceRole` bypasses them, so use it only after authenticating the caller (`.middleware([requireUser])`) and checking they may access the records involved: server functions and server routes are public endpoints anyone can call with any input. See **Server Security** in `AGENTS.md`. Call it only in handlers that need Base44: it reads the platform headers, and a handler that never calls it works without them.
- **Secrets** are read in server code with `import { secrets } from "base44:runtime"` → `secrets.get("NAME")`, inside a handler. Never `process.env`.
- **Server routes** (`src/routes/api/*.js`) are raw HTTP endpoints for URLs something other than the app's own code requests (webhooks, downloads, feeds); the app's pages call server functions. `src/start.js` runs every request through `base44RequestMiddleware`, so their `server.handlers` receive the same `context.getBase44()` (`({ request, params, context }) => …`).
- **Server-only code** lives in `*.server.js` files (TanStack refuses to bundle them for the browser).
- **Auth** is resolved client-side after hydration (`useAuth()`); the server is anonymous on a document request, so give per-user pages `ssr: false`.
- **Sign-in and gated pages** are not wired in the starter: `src/components/auth/` holds the pages (login, register, password reset, MCP consent) and a login gate for `src/routes/_authed/`, to add when the app needs them. See **Adding Authentication** in `AGENTS.md`.
- **AI**: TanStack AI is installed and runs on the Base44 AI gateway, with no API key and usage billed to the app's AI credits. `gatewayModel(context.getBase44())` in `src/lib/ai.server.js` builds the adapter; `AGENTS.md` has a streaming chat example (a server route plus `useChat`).
- **Caching**: the platform caches only what a route opts into via `headers()` (`Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=…`). Everything else is served fresh.
